# .scloudignore
#
# This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored when 
# uploading to Serverpod Cloud. It functions similarly to a .gitignore file, 
# preventing listed files from being included in deployments.
#
# Serverpod Cloud also respects .gitignore, meaning any files ignored by Git 
# will not be uploaded unless explicitly opted back in. 
# For example, generated files that are gitignored must be included if they 
# need to be uploaded.
#
# Note: All hidden files and folders (those starting with a dot ".") are 
# ignored by default unless explicitly included.
#

# Ignoring all passwords, service passwords such as for the database are 
# automatically managed by Serverpod Cloud.
# If you need to configure custom api keys or other passwords, you can do so by
# using the `scloud secret create --name <name> --value <value>` command.
#
# Run `scloud secret --help` for more information.
