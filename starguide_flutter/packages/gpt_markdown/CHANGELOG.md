## 1.2.1+starguide.1

Starguide's fork of 1.2.1, made so answers render the way the Serverpod
website renders Markdown. Content that sets none of the new fields looks
exactly as before.

### Added

* `GptMarkdownStyleSheet.spacing`, a `BlockSpacing` with a margin per kind of
  block — paragraph, each heading level, list, list item, table, code block,
  blockquote, rule and maths. The gap between two blocks is the larger of the
  neighbouring margins, as CSS collapses margins, and no longer depends on
  whether the source had a blank line between them.
* `TableStyle.textStyle`, `verticalBorders`, `fillWidth` and
  `verticalAlignment`. `headerTextStyle` and `rowStripeColor` are now applied;
  they were accepted but never used.
* `ListStyle.markerWidth`, a fixed box the bullet or `1.` is end-aligned in so
  text starts at one indent in every list, and `ListStyle.nestedIndent`, the
  indent per nesting level of an item written with leading spaces.

### Changed

* Horizontal `InlineCodeStyle.padding` now takes real space next to the code.
  Before, the chip was painted over the neighbouring words.

### Removed

* LaTeX rendering, with the `flutter_math_fork` dependency, `latexBuilder`,
  `latexWorkaround`, `useDollarSignsForLatex` and `LatexStyle`. Starguide
  answers hold no maths, and the package's twenty KaTeX fonts were downloaded
  by every visitor before the first frame. The RTL placeholder reordering is
  kept, but its tests used maths as the inline widget and went with it.
* The bundled JetBrains Mono. Code still defaults to a family of that name,
  which the app declares itself.

## 1.2.1

### Changed

* Radio list markers use `RadioGroup` instead of `Radio.groupValue` and
  `Radio.onChanged`, which Flutter deprecated in 3.32. No visual or behavioural
  change — the marker looks and responds exactly as before.
* Minimum Flutter is now **3.32.0**, the release `RadioGroup` was added in.

### Added

* `InlinePattern.delimited` for tokens that open and close, such as `:emoji:`,
  `::spoiler::` or `{{token}}` — the counterpart to `InlinePattern.prefixed`,
  which cannot express a closing delimiter. The token name is the named group
  `name`. See [docs/inline-syntax.md](docs/inline-syntax.md).

## 1.2.0

Upgrading from 1.1.x? See [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md).

### Changed

* Deprecated `highlightBuilder`. Use `inlineCodeStyle` for appearance, or
  `inlineCodeBuilder` for full control. It still works, is now aligned on the
  text baseline, and will be removed in 2.0.0.
* Inline code renders as a monospace chip that wraps across lines. Restyle with
  `inlineCodeStyle`.
* Autolinking is on by default. Disable with `autolink: false`, and remove any
  pre-processor that rewrites bare URLs.
* `ImageMd`, `TableMd` and `ATagMd` no longer render inside link labels. Custom
  components opt out with `scopes`.
* Malformed links and unclaimed matches render as plain text instead of being
  dropped silently.
* Component dispatch is anchored as `^(?:pattern)$`, so a pattern containing a
  top-level `|` no longer claims matches it does not cover.
* Case-insensitive component patterns now match.
* Tests using `find.byType(RichText)` need
  `find.byWidgetPredicate((w) => w is RichText)` — some paragraphs render as a
  `RichText` subclass.

### Added

* Streaming reveal for generated replies, off by default:
  `GptMarkdown(text, animation: GptMarkdownAnimation.fade, isStreaming: true)`.
  Only the part of the reply that can still change is rebuilt, so the cost per
  token stays flat as the reply grows. The reveal keeps up with a fast model,
  fast-forwards when `isStreaming` turns false, and honours reduced motion.
  See [docs/streaming.md](docs/streaming.md).
* `GptMarkdownStyleSheet` with twelve per-component style classes, settable per
  widget or app-wide on `GptMarkdownThemeData`. Unset fields keep the previous
  defaults.
* Builders for every component: `blockQuoteBuilder`, `headingBuilder`,
  `checkboxBuilder`, `radioOptionBuilder`, `hrBuilder`.
* Callbacks `onCheckboxChanged`, `onCodeCopy`, `onImageTap`, `onSourceTagTap`.
* `InlinePattern` for app-specific inline syntax such as `@mention`,
  `#channel` and `:emoji:`, with `InlinePattern.prefixed` for the common case.
* `MarkdownScope` and `MarkdownComponent.scopes` — components declare which
  nesting contexts they render in.
* Autolinks following the GFM autolink extension and CommonMark §6.5, with
  `autolinkSchemes` for app schemes.
* `GptMarkdownConfig` and the builder typedefs are exported from the main
  import.

### Fixed

* Text scaling: components rendered through a `WidgetSpan` reserved up to 39x
  the space they needed at a 2x system font setting. Every component now scales
  proportionally.
* Theme changes did not repaint — colours are resolved when spans are built,
  and the cache was not invalidated.
* `GptMarkdownConfig.isSame` ignored several fields, so runtime changes to
  components, inline patterns and styles did nothing.
* Inline widgets in right-to-left paragraphs render in visual order
  ([flutter#54400](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/54400)).
* `GptMarkdownConfig.getRich` returns `Widget` instead of `Text`.

## 1.1.8

* 🔗 Fixed consecutive links separated by single newlines not rendering ([#142](https://github.com/Infinitix-LLC/gpt_markdown/issues/142)).

## 1.1.7

* Added/updated the interactive playground and pub.dev example flow, with `playground.dart` as a dedicated playground entry and improved demo content for links, lists, blockquotes, tables, and LaTeX.
* Updated package metadata: bumped to `1.1.7`, set `homepage` to [gptmarkdown.com](https://gptmarkdown.com), and added `repository` + `issue_tracker`.
* Bumped `flutter_math_fork` to `^0.7.4` for Flutter 3.35+ compatibility.
* Fixed bold markdown rendering across newlines by enabling `dotAll` in `BoldMd`.
* Fixed link styling so underline/color (including hover color) apply consistently across nested inline spans (bold/italic) inside links via `LinkSpanBuilder`.
* Extended `imageBuilder` to receive parsed size metadata from markdown image syntax (`context, imageUrl, width, height`).
* Resolved deprecated radio API usage by wrapping `Radio<bool>` with `RadioGroup` in custom radio rendering.
* Cleaned up and corrected docs/example markdown content for the updated API and examples.

## 1.1.6

* Added `hrLinePadding` to `GptMarkdownThemeData` (default `EdgeInsets.zero`), wired through the public factory, `copyWith`, and `lerp`, for padding around horizontal rules and the optional line after `#` headings.
* Added `autoAddDividerLineAfterH1` to `GptMarkdownThemeData` (default `true`), with the same factory / `copyWith` / `lerp` support, so the extra divider after a level-1 heading can be toggled from theme data.
* Added `padding` to `CustomDivider` (default `EdgeInsets.zero`); the render object lays out and paints the stroke inside those insets and uses the constrained width when drawing.
* Added `GptMarkdownThemeData.isSame` to compare every field on the theme data type.
* `HTag` and `HrLine` use `hrLineColor`, `hrLinePadding`, and `autoAddDividerLineAfterH1` from `GptMarkdownTheme.of(context)` for the horizontal line widgets.

## 1.1.5

* Fixed block latex markdown syntax.

* 🧹 Removed erroneous `trim()` from `CodeBlockMd` to preserve necessary whitespace in code blocks ([#99](https://github.com/Infinitix-LLC/gpt_markdown/issues/99))
* 🎨 Fixed heading style customization issue where custom colors in heading styles were not being applied ([#95](https://github.com/Infinitix-LLC/gpt_markdown/issues/95))

## 1.1.3

* Added `RadioGroup` widget for managing radio buttons.
* Updated to align with Flutter 3.35 by resolving the deprecations of `Radio.groupValue` and `Radio.onChanged`.
